CHGRP(1)                         User Commands                        CHGRP(1)



NAME
       chgrp - change group ownership

SYNOPSIS
       chgrp [OPTION]... GROUP FILE...
       chgrp [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Change  the  group of each FILE to GROUP.  With --reference, change the
       group of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       --dereference
              affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the default),
              rather than the symbolic link itself

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (useful
              only on systems that can change the ownership of a symlink)

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat `/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on `/'

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's group rather than specifying a GROUP value

       -R, --recursive
              operate on files and directories recursively

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when  the  -R
       option  is  also  specified.   If  more than one is specified, only the
       final one takes effect.

       -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link  to  a  directory,
              traverse it

       -L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

EXAMPLES
       chgrp staff /u
              Change the group of /u to "staff".

       chgrp -hR staff /u
              Change the group of /u and subfiles to "staff".
