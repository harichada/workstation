NAME
    for - Execute commands for each member in a list.

SYNOPSIS
    for NAME [in WORDS ... ] ; do COMMANDS; done

DESCRIPTION
    Execute commands for each member in a list.
    
    The `for' loop executes a sequence of commands for each member in a
    list of items.  If `in WORDS ...;' is not present, then `in "$@"' is
    assumed.  For each element in WORDS, NAME is set to that element, and
    the COMMANDS are executed.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns the status of the last command executed.

SEE ALSO
    bash(1)

IMPLEMENTATION
    GNU bash, version 4.1.5(1)-release (i486-pc-linux-gnu)

NAME
    for (( - Arithmetic for loop.

SYNOPSIS
    for (( exp1; exp2; exp3 )); do COMMANDS; done

DESCRIPTION
    Arithmetic for loop.
    
    Equivalent to
    	(( EXP1 ))
    	while (( EXP2 )); do
    		COMMANDS
    		(( EXP3 ))
    	done
    EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3 are arithmetic expressions.  If any expression is
    omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to 1.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns the status of the last command executed.
