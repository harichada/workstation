KILL(1)                       Linux User's Manual                      KILL(1)



NAME
       kill - send a signal to a process


SYNOPSIS
       kill [ -signal | -s signal ] pid ...
       kill [ -L | -V, --version ]
       kill -l  [ signal ]


DESCRIPTION
       The  default  signal  for  kill is TERM. Use -l or -L to list available
       signals.  Particularly useful signals include  HUP,  INT,  KILL,  STOP,
       CONT,  and  0.   Alternate  signals  may be specified in three ways: -9
       -SIGKILL -KILL.  Negative PID  values  may  be  used  to  choose  whole
       process  groups;  see the PGID column in ps command output. A PID of -1
       is special; it indicates all processes except the kill  process  itself
       and init.


SIGNALS
       The  signals  listed  below  may  be available for use with kill.  When
       known constant, numbers and default behavior are shown.

NOTES
       Your shell (command line interpreter) may have a built-in kill command.
       You  may  need  to run the command described here as /bin/kill to solve
       the conflict.


EXAMPLES
       kill -9 -1
              Kill all processes you can kill.

       kill -l 11
              Translate number 11 into a signal name.

       kill -L
              List the available signal choices in a nice table.

       kill 123 543 2341 3453
              Send the default signal, SIGTERM, to all those processes.

STANDARDS
       This command meets appropriate standards. The  -L  flag  is  Linux-spe‚Äê
       cific.


AUTHOR
       Albert  Cahalan  <albert@users.sf.net>  wrote kill in 1999 to replace a
       bsdutils one that was not standards compliant. The util-linux one might
       also work correctly.
