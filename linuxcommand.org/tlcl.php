                    Designed for the new command line user, this 555-page volume covers
                    the same material as LinuxCommand.org but in much greater detail.  In
                    addition to the basics of command line use and shell scripting, <i>The
                    Linux Command Line</i> includes chapters on many common programs used on
                    the command line, as well as more advanced topics.

    <h2>What Readers Are Saying About <i>The Linux Command Line</i>!</h2>

    <blockquote><i>"I have been using Linux for a little over a year. Read as
    much as I could including Rute, and many others. I have learned more in the
    first 93 pages of your book than any others!!!!"</i></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>"What a great help your book has been for me! I was looking for
    a book like yours, but I never was able to find one that really walks the
    reader through the Linux command line in a general sort of way. Do you know
    of any others? If I recall, there are a lot of books dedicated to shell
    scripting, but none that are geared to regular command-line
    use."</i></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>"Fantastic book!! I have recently switched from the legacy OS
    to Linux and I have been trying to find a distro that mimics this legacy OS
    in fear of using the terminal. I ran across this book and opened the
    terminal for the first time. This book teaches you everything you need to
    know about the shell and does it with ease. It starts by giving you a solid
    foundation and builds from there. Its simplicity and informative structure
    is ideal for all new beginners switching to Linux. I am now always on the
    terminal even for the simplest things. Not only does this build love, but I
    also get to practice my shell scripting. Great book!!"</i></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>"I've been enjoying reading the book and have learned a lot
    from every chapter.  Your writing is very clear, and I've enjoyed following
    along with your examples.  I've skimmed a couple of Linux books before, but
    never had enough time to really get into them.  From those experiences
    however, I think your book is much clearer and approachable for
    beginners."</i></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>"WOW! What a great book. It will clearly provide a stepping
    stone for many people who want to wean themselves off of their GUI habit,
    or perhaps just "Make the difficult possible."</i></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>"I think one of the greatest assets of the book that most
    others about Linux don't have is the conversational tone.  I feel like in
    almost every chapter, there are parts where you lead the reader to ask
    questions of the material that aren't necessarily covered."</i></blockquote>
